SpillJuice
========

SpillJuice is a set of scripts that use SExtractor and DS9 to
cross-match proper fits files.

Make Juice from sExtract(or) and watch it Spill through DS9.

To use type:
	python spilljuice.py

SpillJuice will:
 look for fits files within a list (images.lis);
 create catalogs using SExtractor of those in the list;
 will cross-match, using SAO DS9, the SExtractor catalog output 
 	with cds II/336 APASS catalog; and
 create a crossed-matched catalog in a seperate Juiced directory.

Juice creates directories within your fits file directory called:
	juice/juice_cats
	juice/juice_sex

Spill creates a directory within the juice directory called:
	matched_cats
